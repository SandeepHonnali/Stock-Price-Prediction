The code you provided outlines the process for **stock price prediction using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**, which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). LSTMs are designed to handle sequential data, such as stock prices over time, and can capture long-term dependencies in the data. Below is a description of the process and how you might summarize it:

## **Stock Price Prediction using LSTM**

### **Objective**:
This project aims to predict stock prices using LSTM, a type of Recurrent Neural Network, to forecast future stock prices based on historical data. The primary focus is to forecast the closing stock prices.

### **Steps Involved**:

#### **1. Data Loading**:
The historical stock data for a specific company (AABA in this case, from 2006 to 2018) is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. The 'Date' column is set as the index.

#### **2. Data Preprocessing**:
- The dataset is preprocessed, where the 'Close' column (the closing price) is selected for prediction.
- The data is normalized using `MinMaxScaler` to scale the features to the range (0, 1), as LSTM models perform better with scaled input values.

#### **3. Dataset Creation**:
- The dataset is transformed into a sequence format. Each sequence (X) corresponds to 60 previous days' prices, and the target (y) corresponds to the closing price on the 61st day.

#### **4. Train-Test Split**:
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets. Typically, 80% is used for training, and the remaining 20% is used for testing.

#### **5. LSTM Model Architecture**:
- An LSTM model is built with two LSTM layers (each with 50 units) and a Dense layer with a single unit to predict the stock price.
- The model is compiled using the **Adam optimizer** and **Mean Squared Error loss** function.

#### **6. Model Training**:
- The LSTM model is trained over 10 epochs with a batch size of 32.
  
#### **7. Predictions and Rescaling**:
- The trained model is used to predict stock prices for the test set.
- Predictions are then rescaled back to their original values (the unscaled stock prices) using the inverse transformation of the scaler.

#### **8. Plotting the Results**:
- The actual stock prices and predicted stock prices are plotted for comparison.

#### **9. Model Evaluation (RMSE)**:
- The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric is computed to evaluate the performance of the model. A lower RMSE indicates better accuracy in the stock price prediction.

### **Evaluation**:
- The model performance is assessed using the RMSE score, which helps quantify the difference between predicted and actual stock prices. A lower RMSE value reflects how close the predictions are to the true stock prices.

### **Key Insights**:
- **LSTM models** excel at handling sequential data, making them highly suitable for time series forecasting such as stock prices.
- Proper **data scaling** is crucial for LSTM to make accurate predictions.
- The **RMSE metric** offers an easy-to-understand quantification of prediction accuracy.
